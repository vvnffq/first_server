        <h3> When you lie down on the pillow at night, what do you hear? </h3>
        <p> The concept of this installation is based on my own complex feelings after witnessing others go through traumatic events. I believe many people have experienced similar feelings: for example, after reading a depressing news story about social injustice, one might feel an intense wave of emotions, but one wouldn’t know what one can do about it, and most of the time one would not have the position or ability to do anything about it. These feelings often occupy my mind late at night, sometimes preventing me from sleeping, or sometimes giving me nightmares. When I try to narrate what I’ve witnessed or felt, it often sounds like I was sleep talking——illogical, imaginary, and meaningless. A voice in my head would tell me to "forget it, sleep it off, and go back to your daily routine". Slowly, I began to realize that this voice was not me convincing myself, but rather a ubiquitous voice hypnotizing each and every one of us. </p>
